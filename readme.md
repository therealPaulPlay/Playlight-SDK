# Playlight (SDK)

Playlight is an integrable game discovery platform.

## Installation

Please refer to [the docs](https://playlight.dev/docs).
If you want to contribute to the docs, you can access the [source](https://github.com/therealPaulPlay/Playlight-Site/blob/main/src/routes/docs/%2Bpage.svelte) here.
The package is also available on [NPM](https://npmjs.com) under the name `playlight-sdk`.

## Developing

The Playlight SDK uses [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) together with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Run `npm run build` to create a fresh build, and test the SDK using the `index.html` file found in the `/example` folder.
To view it, start a live server (e.g. with the live server VSCode extension).

The `index.js` file is the entry point of the project and mounts the main `App.svelte` component.
