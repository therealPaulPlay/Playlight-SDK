# Playlight (SDK)
Playlight is the integrable game discovery platform of the future.

## Installation
Coming soon.

## Developing

The Playlight SDK uses [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) together with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Shadcn-Svelte components](https://next.shadcn-svelte.com/).
Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
